Code Style Guide
The coding style follows the JavaScript Standard Style guide

The JavaScript Standard Style:

- automatically format code
- catch style issues and coding errors early
- uses two spaces for identation
- uses single quotes for strings
- does not allow unused variables
- does not allow semicolons
- does not allow starting a line with ( or [ or `
- use space after keywords
- use === instead of == checking equality
- always handles the Node.js err function parameter
- always prefix browser globals with "window" except "document" and "navigator"
- prevents accidental use of poorly-named browser globals like "open, length, event, and name"

The JavaScript Standard Style guide have many more rules.
